A little project which is a website that allow users to generate and download Alpaca avatar.

- Live demo available [here](https://mattordre44.github.io/alpaca_generator/)

This was made thanks to Front-end framework ReactJS in Typescript, this might not be appropriate for simple app like this but it is usefull to train on react concepts such as function components, react hook : useState, useCallback, useEffect and so on. Moreover this app was built using react context which permit to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down at every components level.
